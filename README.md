# This project is a Rental House Management System built using Flask and SQLite. It includes a complete backend database with tables for users, properties, leases, units, payments, and maintenance requests. The web application provides a modern login page, a dashboard with key rental statistics, a properties management page, an add property form, and a payments chart using Chart.js. Bootstrap is used to create a clean and responsive interface. The system demonstrates full CRUD functionality and real interaction between the web app and the SQLite database
